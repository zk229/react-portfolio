                Hello!  My name is Zach Kirsche and I am a former high school teacher and aspiring web developer.  I have experience with full-stack web development, but my passion is for building backends.  I have experience with Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, React, and many other technologies for modern web design.  On this website you can find examples of full MERN stack applications, including modern PWAs.  I like to apply my skills to my hobbies, particularly gaming, so you can expect to see several projects revolving around that theme.  This site will be updated periodically with new projects as I continue to develop new skills and explore new ideas.
            </p>

                I am also a former high school teacher with experience teaching computer science and mathematics.  I am very passionate about pedagogy and would love some day develop technologies to help increase accessibility and bridge the achievement gap in these areas.  Being a teacher has given me a unique set of skills for communicating about code and finding flexible solutions to problems that work with what's already there.  It has also helped me to become very skilled at debugging and working through the many challenges that come with learning about code.
